### Dark or triggering minor AR corrections

### HARD MODE 

For situations that would be _really_ hard to fix (if fix is even possible)

#### Gradient incorrectly triggers aspect ratio correction

IGN: Hollow Knight Review | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg25ONutphA (Should be mostly fixed as of 4.0.0)

#### Text triggers autodetection 

If detected edge is text, extension shouldn't crop.
