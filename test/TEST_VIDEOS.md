### Variable aspect ratio

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_u97PqWX6g (also dark at the start)

### Dark or triggering minor AR corrections

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9Oubxw1gA (triggers autocorrection every now and then)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaTGwlfRB_c (dark, triggers minor corrections)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw5Z93Yt-UQ&t=410 (@ts, dark, resets aspect ratio for no reason within 15s)

### Watermark stopping AR

### HARD MODE 

For situations that would be _really_ hard to fix (if fix is even possible)

#### Gradient incorrectly triggers aspect ratio correction

IGN: Hollow Knight Review | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg25ONutphA (Should be mostly fixed as of 4.0.0)

#### Text triggers autodetection 

If detected edge is text, extension shouldn't crop.
