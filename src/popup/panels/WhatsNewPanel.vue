    <ul>
      <li>Fixed alignment issues for reddit on videos from v.reddit</li>
      <li>Some people reported issues with inconsistent video alignment on youtube. While I've not been able to make that bug happen to me,
        (which means I haven't been able to fix it either), reports describe behaviour similar to what was going on with Iridium. Examining
        the Iridium issue revealed an issue that could be potentially blamed for this behaviour. That issue was fixed. Since I've never been able to make this problem
        happen to me, I'm not being able to verify whether that issue is gone. <b>If you're still experiencing issues with inconsistent video alignment,
          please contact me via github, reddit or email.</b> See 'Report a problem' tab for more details.</li>
