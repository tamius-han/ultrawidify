    <p>Full changelog for older versions <a href="https://github.com/tamius-han/ultrawidify/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">is available here</a>.</p>
    <p class="label">5.0.1</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Disabled Chrome's and Edge's zoom limitation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added an option to toggle and further configure zoom limitation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <small><b>NOTE:</b> zoom limitations were introduced as a workaround for a bug caused by Chrome's/Edge's faulty hardware acceleration
      which caused videos to be incorrectly stretched on nVidia GPUs while in fullscreen. While this issue is reportedly fixed as
      of few weeks ago, a few people reported having this issue within the past two weeks.</small>
