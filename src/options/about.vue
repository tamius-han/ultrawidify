    <p>If you're curious about the source code, <a href="https://github.com/tamius-han/ultrawidify">github's here</a>. It's available under sorta-you-can-look-but-you-can't-touch licence, meaning: you can look, I won't mind if you shoot me a pull request, but I will mind if you're just gonna reupload this extension to the AMO/Chrome store.</p>
    <p>If you're looking at this page because you're bored and want to be bored some more, <a href="https://tamius.net">my website's here</a> and <a href="https://stuff.tamius.net/sacred-texts/">my blog is here</a>.</p>
    <p>I already have a 'donation' tab, but if you want to buy me a beer, <a href="https://paypal.me/tamius">my paypal's here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Plans for the future</h2>
    <p>Improving automatic detection, trying to re-implement in-player user interface (confirmed!), fixing bugs. Maybe even give the settings page a facelift.</p>
    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>This extension uses font <a href="http://overpassfont.org/">Overpass</a> and everything <a href="https://github.com/Kocal/vue-web-extension">this Vue template brings along</a>.</p> 

    <h2>Special thanks to</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyone who reports bugs</li>
      <li>Everyone who waited for about 6-8 months for the 4.0 release. It was supposed to be released by the end of December 2018, we're in April. It was a major rewrite, though.</li>
      <li>Everyone who donated at any point in time.</li>
      <li>me for making this extension. You're welcome.</li>
