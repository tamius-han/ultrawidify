#!/bin/bash

# Takes all the files from 'src' and compiles it intro a single content script.
# Also compiles background scripts and settings pages. 
#
# I'm using this over something like requirejs so my extension doesn't need even more
# dependencies.
#
# How does this work?
# 0. You're supposed to run this in the root directory of the extension.

# 1. see if file has any #include [filename] comments. If so, merge [filename] file
#    into the current file (after checking if that file has any #include comments
#    Compiled files are saved to /tmp.
# 
# 2. After compiling file and its dependencies, check for presence of #location [directory]
#    comments. [directory] is relative to the root directory of the extension
# 2.1 also check for #out, which defines filename.
#
# 3. Use '-nodebug' to remove all calls of console.log (to be implemented)
