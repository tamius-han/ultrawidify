Microsoft edge extension store requires notes for certification. Because I'm too lazy to whip this text over and over and over and over and over and over again, I'm making it a copypasta.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This extension is targeted at users of 21:9 monitors. If using 16:9 monitor, use youtube in THEATER MODE.

Not all videos need to have their aspect ratio corrected. Here is few examples of videos with problems this extension is trying to solve:

* Variable aspect ratio — autodetection testing grounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IHzprfs6tw 
* Static (but incorrect) aspect ratio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTETsm79D3A

Twitch example (collapse subscription & chat sidebars on 16:9, do not fullscreen) — aspect ratio switch happens at around 1:50:00 mark:
* https://www.twitch.tv/videos/330639009?t=1h49m45s

Autodetect has technological limitations and can incorrectly detect aspect ratio. This is acceptable — user should override it in such cases.

Functions labelled 'experimental' are experimental and may not function correctly.

Websites may interfere with keyboard shortcuts.

Brief video flicker when changing between fullscreen, non-fullscreen or when changing browser is inherent artifact caused by sites not being aware of extension and is thus considered acceptable.

Logger option does nothing (except give you a popup) unless you have a logger config handy. It is designed for debugging in case of bug reports.
